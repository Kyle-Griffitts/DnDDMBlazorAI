# DnDDMBlazorAI

Welcome adventurer!
This tutorial will guide you through how to summon your own AI chatbot to a Blazor page, complete with it's own personality. In this case, an interactive D&D Dungeon Master!  

## 1. Summon the Source (Installation):

- Clone the repo to your preferred location.
      
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kyle-Griffitts/DnDDMBlazorAI.git
```

## 2. Gather Arcane Components (Requirements):

I. NuGet packages required for this application.

```bash
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Agents.Persistent 
dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI
```

II. AI Foundry chatbot. I used a gpt-4o-mini for this project.
- The json code with the Endpoint will go in User Secrets.
- Right click on the project and select **Manage User Secrets**.
- Copy and paste the below json code.
- Get the AI resource name and replace <your-resource-name> with it.
- Example: `https://ai-resource-name.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`

```json
{
  "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT": "https://<your-resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
}
```

## 3. Craft the Personality Scroll (Character Prompts):

I. There are two areas in the **DungeonMasterChatService.cs** where you can customize your own personality. First is the intro prompt.

- You can type anything to give your AI context about their personality here.
- The **SystemPrompt** string will not be displayed. It exists to put the AI chat bot into character before any interaction.
- The **FallbackClassPrompt** string is the initial message to be displayed in the chat window to get you started on your adventure.
      
```cs
    // AI prompts
    public static class DungeonMasterPrompts
    {
        public const string SystemPrompt =
            "You are a Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master guiding a {playerClass}. " +
            "Narrate adventures, describe settings, control NPCs, and guide the player through imaginative scenarios. " +
            "Be creative, engaging, and always stay in character as a DM. " +
            "Use a max of 10 sentences and make them easy to read. Put each idea on a new line.";

        public const string FallbackClassPrompt =
            "Before we begin, tell me your class so I can tailor your adventures. " +
            "Are you a Rogue, Wizard, Paladin, Ranger, or something else?";
    }
```

II. The next section is an prompt enricher to give more context to the AI once someone declares a class, writes messages, or interacts with the dice rolls.

```cs
    // Method to enrich the AI prompt based on player message and class. Also includes formatting.
    private string BuildEnrichedPrompt(string userMessage)
    {
        var enrichedRollMessage = $"{userMessage}\n\nClass Context: {_playerClass}\nSuggested Actions:\n\nPlease expand narratively based on the player's intent and class abilities. " +
            $"If the player provides a dice roll, interpret it as a test of chance or skill." +
            $"\r\nAbility Context: {_lastAbilityContext} Use the rollâ€™s number and class abilities to shape dramatic outcomes." +
            $"\r\nPrompt rolls from the correct sided dice. Available dice to the player are D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, and D4";

        return enrichedRollMessage;
    }
```
